 To get started with the Quest Guide, go to the following page in a web browser
       (Be sure to use http, as https will take you to the PE console)

                           http://$IP_ADDRESS

    If you cannot access the Quest Guide, your IP address may have changed.
     To get the correct address, log in as root and type: facter ipaddress
